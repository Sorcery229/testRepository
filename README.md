### My journey to pursuing a PhD in Computer Science

All the preconceived notions I held about computer science at UCLA were thrown out the window after the first year of classes. From dissecting assembly code to developing a router in C, I was exposed to a broad range of topics that led me to discover that software engineering is only a minuscule part of computer science. To open myself to the true range and potential of computing, I discovered an alternate path in academic research. Through genomics, I was able to set a clear direction for my path in computer science: harnessing the unprecedented scalability and precision of computational methods to develop quantitative solutions in biomedicine.



### Intro to academia: finding faculty and research collaborators (ZarLab UCLA, Mangul Lab USC)

Having had little to no idea of UCLA’s opportunities in computer science research, I consulted my engineering faculty advisor Dr. Eleazar Eskin. Since he specialized in computational genomics, I became exposed to undergraduate research programs, scholarship opportunities, and course tracks that would cater my degree to the field. With the benefit of hindsight, here are tips that I found helpful in getting a headstart on research:\
Searching for a faculty advisor. Professors are often incredibly busy with their schedules, and not all of them are guaranteed to accommodate undergraduates in their lab. I was fortunate to have found Dr. Eskin’s ZarLab quite early on in my undergrad at UCLA. In order to forge my path in academia, I would refer to the following resources:

- **Broadening your network.** Through my first research project at ZarLab, I met Dr. Serghei Mangul as my postdoc mentor. Dr. Mangul soon joined USC as an assistant professor at the School of Pharmacy. I continue to seek research opportunities and helpful professional advice from him to this day. To expand your network in academia, you can reach out to different faculty within the same department or partake in summer research programs at different institutions.
Fully funded research programs. Faculty advisors who participate in funded research programs, such as NSF REUs, are most likely to support undergraduate research. I worked full-time under Dr. Eskin and Dr. Mangul as a funded student researcher in the Bruins in Genomics (B.I.G) Summer Institute program. You can read more about my experiences at B.I.G Summer and discovering bioinformatics here:

- **Faculty advising hours.** UCLA Engineering required professors to dedicate biweekly hours toward advising students 1 on 1. I would find time to meet Dr. Eskin through faculty advising to learn more about opportunities in bioinformatics and he helped me get started on a research project right away during my first year at UCLA.
- **Find the best method of communication.** Some professors are simply more available on other platforms such as Slack. Make sure to ask and clarify which way is best to reach out and contact them. Attending regular lab meetings is also a guaranteed way to get face time with your professor.

### Publications: navigating the unpredictable road
While working under Dr. Eskin, I joined a project on benchmarking structural variant callers. Dr. Mangul, my postdoc mentor at the time, guided me and my fellow undergraduate collaborators through the publishing process.\
I learned quickly that the road to publication wasn’t straightforward. Despite working on the structural variant project throughout my entire undergrad and the preprint being finished by my third year, the paper was not accepted until the summer after I graduated from UCLA:
https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/23/4/bbac221/6618239?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false
I was also fortunate to join another research project — benchmarking error-correction methods — which was successfully published in Genome Biology:
https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-01988-3
Having undertaken two separate research endeavors, I learned the following from Dr. Mangul’s mentorship on overcoming the unpredictability of publishing research:
1. **Overlapping literature.** Ensure that there are no published papers on the same subject matter. While I worked on the structural variant project, another benchmarking effort was accepted at Genome Biology a year or two into the project which prompted us to reconsider our approach.
2. **Differentiability.** What unique factors would make your work stand out? It is best to understand the demands of the field and how your research would help progress. Discussing ideas with fellow researchers at conferences and journal reviewers would help ensure that your work can stand out against the rest.
3. **Drafts don’t have to be bullet-proof.** It is perfectly understandable to be rejected multiple times. In fact, submitting drafts and receiving feedback early on could help you work out the necessary areas of improvement that should be covered so that you make a robust paper.
4. **Make your work presentable.** Besides submitting drafts, you can present your work at conferences and use the discussion and questions to test your research in the eyes of your fellow peers. Presentation and clear communication of the ideas is an absolute must to facilitate this process. The same is true for the paper itself, as the abstract and important figures must effectively demonstrate your key ideas.
### Internships: undergrad research as a window into the industry
*Toward the end of my first year, I took upper-division computer science courses in bioinformatics at UCLA. Getting a head start on learning advanced algorithms and tools improved my capabilities as a computer scientist and researcher. I was able to apply valuable skills from bioinformatics (Bash, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, high-performance computing) to academic coursework. For instance, I trained a neural network on a large dataset for my natural language processing class much faster by running parallel jobs on UCLA’s GPU clusters. The same skill set would prove to be essential in industry.*
My unique skill set and experience in bioinformatics research led me to pursue a summer internship opportunity at Illumina, the current industry leader in DNA sequencing. The bioinformatics intern position was a perfect fit for my research background.

The hiring process. While the usual rule of thumb is to keep your resume limited to a single page for industry, I decided to submit a longer CV-style resume that emphasized the following:
