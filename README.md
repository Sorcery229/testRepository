### My journey to pursuing a PhD in Computer Science

All the preconceived notions I held about computer science at UCLA were thrown out the window after the first year of classes. From dissecting assembly code to developing a router in C, I was exposed to a broad range of topics that led me to discover that software engineering is only a minuscule part of computer science. To open myself to the true range and potential of computing, I discovered an alternate path in academic research. Through genomics, I was able to set a clear direction for my path in computer science: harnessing the unprecedented scalability and precision of computational methods to develop quantitative solutions in biomedicine.\



### Intro to academia: finding faculty and research collaborators (ZarLab UCLA, Mangul Lab USC)

Having had little to no idea of UCLA’s opportunities in computer science research, I consulted my engineering faculty advisor Dr. Eleazar Eskin. Since he specialized in computational genomics, I became exposed to undergraduate research programs, scholarship opportunities, and course tracks that would cater my degree to the field. With the benefit of hindsight, here are tips that I found helpful in getting a headstart on research:\
Searching for a faculty advisor. Professors are often incredibly busy with their schedules, and not all of them are guaranteed to accommodate undergraduates in their lab. I was fortunate to have found Dr. Eskin’s ZarLab quite early on in my undergrad at UCLA. In order to forge my path in academia, I would refer to the following resources:\

- **Broadening your network.** Through my first research project at ZarLab, I met Dr. Serghei Mangul as my postdoc mentor. Dr. Mangul soon joined USC as an assistant professor at the School of Pharmacy. I continue to seek research opportunities and helpful professional advice from him to this day. To expand your network in academia, you can reach out to different faculty within the same department or partake in summer research programs at different institutions.
Fully funded research programs. Faculty advisors who participate in funded research programs, such as NSF REUs, are most likely to support undergraduate research. I worked full-time under Dr. Eskin and Dr. Mangul as a funded student researcher in the Bruins in Genomics (B.I.G) Summer Institute program. You can read more about my experiences at B.I.G Summer and discovering bioinformatics here:\

- **Faculty advising hours.** UCLA Engineering required professors to dedicate biweekly hours toward advising students 1 on 1. I would find time to meet Dr. Eskin through faculty advising to learn more about opportunities in bioinformatics and he helped me get started on a research project right away during my first year at UCLA.\
- **Find the best method of communication.** Some professors are simply more available on other platforms such as Slack. Make sure to ask and clarify which way is best to reach out and contact them. Attending regular lab meetings is also a guaranteed way to get face time with your professor.\
